Title: Ignition temperature of hybrid mixtures

This project was undertaken as a part of the NEX-HYS project which aims at developing a new European standard for the testing of hybrid mixtures. A hybrid mixture of combustible starch dust and n-heptane solvent was tested. A modified Godbert-Greenwald furnace was introduced in the thesis for the testing of hybrid mixtures. The results prove that dust or a solvent vapor can be ignited below its individual minimum ignition temperature when a second component which is below its minimum explosion limit is added to form a hybrid mixture.
